# ZFS-FD Cleanup Fix Summary

## The Problem
The zfs-fd tool creates snapshots with holds (`du_analysis_hold`) to prevent accidental deletion during analysis. However, if these holds are not properly released, they **block ZFS replication** because syncoid cannot destroy old snapshots that have holds.

## The Fix

### 1. Enhanced zfs-fd-cleanup script
- Added `--holds-only` option for emergency hold cleanup
- **ALWAYS** runs hold cleanup first, before any other operations
- Searches for ALL du-holder snapshots system-wide, not just under clone base
- Releases holds even if other cleanup operations fail
- Provides clear feedback about holds that could block replication

### 2. Improved error handling in main zfs-fd script
- Added trap handler in `run_complete_workflow()` to ensure cleanup runs on ANY exit
- Emergency cleanup focuses on releasing holds (using `--holds-only`)
- Clear error messages if hold release fails, warning about replication issues

### 3. Key improvements:
- Hold cleanup is now CRITICAL priority - runs first, always
- System-wide search for du-holder snapshots (not limited to clone base)
- Clear logging and error reporting
- Can be run standalone with `--holds-only` for emergency cleanup

## Usage

### Normal cleanup (after analysis):
```bash
sudo ./zfs-fd-cleanup
```

### Emergency hold cleanup (if replication is blocked):
```bash
sudo ./zfs-fd-cleanup --holds-only
```

### Check for problematic holds:
```bash
# Find all du-holder snapshots
zfs list -t snapshot | grep du-holder

# Check for holds on a specific snapshot
zfs holds pool/dataset@snapshot-name
```

## Prevention
The main `zfs-fd run` workflow now has a trap handler that ensures holds are released even if the workflow fails at any point.
